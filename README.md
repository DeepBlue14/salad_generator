###**Project Synopsis**

This small-scale Tcl/Tk project features a flexible salad recipe generator.

**WARNING**: This program is meant to be primarily a programming project with the intent of being a intermediate Tcl/Tk *practice exercise*.  I in no way suggest that you actually attempt to make a recipe generated by this software.  See the license file for more details.s


###**Introduction**

This allows the user to create new and exciting new salad recipes--all at the click of a button.  Just add a list of potential ingredients and corrisponding images (or merely use the ones provided), and the program will generate a lalad recipe for you!  Technically, it can be used with the ingredients of any dish, not merely salads; however, since no cooking instructions are provided, it was dubbed "salad generator".


###**Build & Run**

**Build**
*(Optional)* ```cd``` to the directory SaladGenerator/res/ingredients.  You can add/remove additional ingredients in the files.  However, every ingredient **must** have a corrisponding png image at ```SaladGenerator/res/ingredients```.  To pair an ingredient and image, give them both the same name; it must begin with a lower-case letter.

**Run**

```cd``` to directory sSaladGenerator.  Then run
```
tclsh SaladGenerator.tcl
```

Select the number of ingredients you desire for each catagory (greens, other veggies, cheeses, meats), and click the "Generate" button.


###**Future Work**

This program was created merely as an intermediate Tcl/Tk practice exercise for myself.  Therefore, I have little motivation or need to flush it out.  However, future improvements may include different types of recipies, or perhaps more advanced logic for ingredient selection.
